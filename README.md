#### Browser Extension for Mozilla Firefox for easy and quick word searches in English Wiktionary.

---

## üí° Purpose Behind the Project

I have recently reignited my passion for learning languages but I found myself constantly opening Wiktionary pages. I realized there had to be a more convenient way to do this, and that's how this project came to be.

I've also been eager to try out making browser extensions for a while, so this was a perfect opportunity to hit two birds with one stone, so to speak. Yeah I know, this isn't the first time such extension has been developed, but for the sake challenging myself this was a fun project. I also really wanted to focus on the UX side of things as well so this was also a good practice on that regard as well.

Hopefully you might find the project useful as I do! Feel free to give feedback too, I appreciate it.

## ‚ùì How To Use

1. Install the extension from Mozilla Firefox extensions page.
2. Activate the extension and select your preferred *anchor language.
3. Highlight a word on a webpage with your cursor, press right click
and select "Search 'word' on Wiktionary".
4. If everything was working as expected, you should now have a new tab with Wiktionary article open.

*\* anchor determines which section of the web page is initially displayed when it loads.*

All credits go to the awesome people behind Wiktionary, Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation. Wiktionary has been an invaluable resource for me as an avid learner and enthusiastic "home linguist". If you enjoyed this project of mine, please consider supporting Wikimedia Projects as well.

From a technical standpoint, much of the script and code was inspired by the MDN Web Docs tutorials and articles on web extensions.
